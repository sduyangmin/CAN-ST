This is the official PyTorch implementation of the paper:  
**"CAN-ST: Clustering Adaptive Normalization for Spatio-temporal OOD Learning"**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
CAN-ST is a general, model-agnostic normalization method for spatio-temporal data that addresses non-stationarity by capturing shared distribution patterns across nodes through adaptive clustering and a parameter register, thereby improving prediction performance under severe spatio-temporal out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

This repo is built on the pioneer works. We appreciate the following GitHub repo a lot for their valuable code base and datasets. For detailed dataset preparation and evaluation protocols, please refer to it.
